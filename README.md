# Depression-and-gut-microbiome-composition-and-functionality
This project aimed to investigate the associations of depression with gut microbiome composition and functionality. We leveraged data from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS), the Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-Based Life-Course and Environmental Research (SIMPLER), and the Estonian Microbiome cohort.

All analyses were performed in R 4.5.0.
